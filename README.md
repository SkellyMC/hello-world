Good Evening Ladies and Gentleman!

I am SkellyMC, I'm a huge fan of computers and technology itself. I've been using my computer since 4 or 5 years old. I love gaming as a hobby and working by researching and doing things about programming, hacking(The good type). I see programming or technology as a very huge, yet outstanding part of my life and I want to use it as a vision or career in the future.
